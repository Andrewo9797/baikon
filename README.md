# Baikon

A revolutionary domain-specific language (DSL) for building intelligent AI agents and conversational systems with human-readable syntax.

## Overview

Baikon transforms how we create AI applications by providing an intuitive, natural language-like syntax that bridges human understanding with powerful execution logic. Build everything from simple chatbots to complex business automation workflows in minutes, not weeks.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/baikondev/baikon.git
cd baikon
pip install -r requirements.txt
python cli.py
```

Try these commands in the CLI:
```
You: hello
Bot: Hi there! I'm your assistant.

You: help
Bot: I can help you schedule meetings, send messages, or fetch data.
```

## Why Baikon?

**Current AI Development Pain Points:**
- Complex framework learning curves
- Scattered code across multiple files
- Difficult state management
- Poor integration between natural language and business logic
- Hard to maintain and iterate

**Baikon Solutions:**
- Intuitive DSL anyone can read and write
- Self-documenting code structure
- Built-in state and variable management
- Enterprise-grade execution engine
- Perfect foundation for visual builders

## Syntax Overview

### Basic Structure
```
flow assistant:
    when user says "hello" -> call greet_user
    when user says "help" -> call show_help

function greet_user:
    say "Hi there! I'm your assistant."

function show_help:
    say "I can help you with various tasks."
```

### Advanced Features
```
version: 2.0

# Variables with persistence
var user_name: string = "Guest"
var conversation_count: int = 0

# Configuration
config:
    timeout: 30
    retry_attempts: 3

# Flows with middleware and conditions
flow customer_service:
    use authentication, logging
    when user says "*refund*" -> call process_refund
    when user says "*help*" -> call show_options
    when var user_mood equals "frustrated" -> call escalate_support

function process_refund:
    set conversation_count = conversation_count + 1
    say "I'll help you with your refund request."
    say "This is conversation #{conversation_count} with {user_name}."
    api post https://api.refunds.com/process with order_data
```

## Architecture

### Parser (`parser.py`)
- Lexical analysis and tokenization
- Abstract syntax tree generation
- Type safety and reference validation
- JSON/YAML export for tooling integration

### Engine (`engine.py`)
- Async flow execution
- Context and variable management
- Middleware processing
- API integration and event handling

### CLI (`cli.py`)
- Interactive development environment
- Real-time flow testing
- Debug and utility commands
- Session persistence

## Examples

### Customer Support Bot
```
flow support:
    when user says "*billing*" -> call handle_billing
    when user says "*technical*" -> call technical_support
    when sentiment equals "angry" -> call escalate_to_human

function handle_billing:
    say "I'll connect you with our billing department."
    api post https://internal.api/tickets with {type: "billing", user: user_id}
    
function technical_support:
    say "Let me help troubleshoot your issue."
    call gather_system_info
```

### E-commerce Assistant
```
var cart_items: json = []

flow shopping:
    when user says "*add * to cart*" -> call add_product
    when user says "checkout" -> call process_checkout

function add_product:
    set product = extract_entity(user_input, "product")
    set cart_items = cart_items + [product]
    say "Added {product} to your cart. Total items: {cart_items.length}"
```

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- No external dependencies for basic functionality

### Development Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/baikondev/baikon.git
cd baikon

# Install development dependencies (optional)
pip install pytest black flake8

# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Start the CLI
python cli.py
```

## Usage

### Basic CLI Commands
```bash
help           # Show available commands
flows          # List all loaded flows  
functions      # List all functions
variables      # Show current variable values
set var=value  # Update variable values
call function  # Execute function directly
debug          # Toggle debug mode
reload         # Hot reload flow files
```

### Creating Custom Flows

1. Create a `.flow` file with your logic
2. Load it in the CLI: `python cli.py your_flow.flow`
3. Test interactively
4. Deploy to production

### Programming Interface
```python
from engine import BaikonEngine

engine = BaikonEngine()
engine.load_module('my_flows.flow')

# Process user input
responses = await engine.process_input("hello", context)
```
