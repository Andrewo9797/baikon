# Baikon DSL
## The First AI-Generatable Framework for Human-Readable Agent Logic

**Baikon is the HTML of AI** - a revolutionary domain-specific language that makes AI agent development readable by humans, generatable by AI, and executable by machines.

> 🔥 **Breakthrough**: AI platforms like ChatGPT and Claude can now generate working production agents in seconds, with zero debugging required.

## 🤯 The Problem Baikon Solves

**Traditional AI agent development:**
```python
# Scattered across 10+ files, complex class hierarchies
class CustomerServiceAgent:
    def process_message(self, message):
        if "angry" in message.lower() or "frustrated" in message.lower():
            if self.context.get('escalation_count', 0) < 2:
                return self.deescalate_response(message)
            else:
                return self.escalate_to_human(message)
        # ... 200 more lines of if/else hell
```

**Baikon approach:**
```yaml
flow customer_service:
    when user says "*angry*" -> call deescalate
    when user says "*refund*" -> call process_refund
    when escalation_needed -> call transfer_to_human
```

## ⚡ Revolutionary Features

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/baikondev/baikon.git
cd baikon
pip install -r requirements.txt
python cli.py main.flow
```

**Try it instantly:**
```
You: hello

```

## 💡 The "HTML of AI" Analogy

**Just like HTML revolutionized web development:**

| HTML → Web | Baikon → AI |
|------------|-------------|
| Separated content from presentation | Separates logic from execution |
| Human-readable markup | Human-readable flows |
| Universal browser support | Universal AI platform support |
| Enabled the web explosion | Enabling the AI agent explosion |

## 🏗️ Enterprise-Grade Examples

### AI-Generated Customer Service Agent
```yaml
# Generated by Claude in 30 seconds, runs perfectly
flow customer_support:
    when user says "*hello*" -> call greet_customer
    when user says "*billing*" -> call handle_billing
    when user says "*technical*" -> call handle_technical
    when user says "*refund*" -> call handle_refund
    when user says "*angry*" -> call handle_escalation

function greet_customer:
    say "Hello! Welcome to our customer support. I'm here to help you today."
    set customer_name = "valued customer"
    say "How can I assist you, {customer_name}?"

function handle_billing:
    say "I'll help you with your billing question."
    say "Are you asking about current charges, account balance, or a billing dispute?"
```

### Self-Marketing Engine (Meta-Innovation)
```yaml
# Baikon markets itself using Baikon!
flow viral_growth:
    when github_stars_increase -> call celebrate_milestone
    when ai_mentioned -> call generate_response  
    when trend_detected -> call create_content
    when timer 9:00 -> call post_morning_thread

function celebrate_milestone:
    say "🎯 {star_count} stars! The community is growing!"
    call generate_social_proof
    call email_ai_companies
```

## 🎯 Architecture
